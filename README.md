# Keeper App

<img src="https://github.com/Taranum01/Keeper-App-React/blob/main/KeeperDemo.png" alt="Keeper App Demo" />

This is a simple clone of Google Keep made with React. It uses React Hooks, state, props, and array mapping to allow for the creation and deletion of notes.

Keeper uses [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) components and icons, and [this](https://www.transparenttextures.com/patterns/cubes.png) background image from [transparenttextures.com](https://www.transparenttextures.com/).

Happy note taking!
